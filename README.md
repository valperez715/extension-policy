# Extension Privacy Policy

## Intro

Different extensions use personal data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses general principles of how this extension collect and handle personal data.

## Data Collection

This extension does not collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.

## Chrome Storage API

Several of my extensions take advantage of [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to locally store minimal state information. This extension only access this data locally on your machine and they do not transmit it.

## Third-Party APIs

The extension accesss third party APIs and report back the results. Generally, when the extension uses these third Party API services, they will send some non-personal information about the page you are visiting. However, when extensions access a third party API, there is some personal information that third party receives in the [request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header), most notably your [IP address](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/what-is-an-ip-address.htm) and [user agent string](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/user-agent). Some companies will use information like that to develop a â€œ[browser fingerprint](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)" that can probably track and personally identify you. Unfortunately, this is not something that I or my extensions have control over. If this is a concern for you, consider using a VPN to mask your IP address.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are substantive<sup>1</sup> changes made to this blanket privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of any of the extension, I will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.
